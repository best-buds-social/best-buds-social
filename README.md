# Best Buds Social

Welcome to Best Buds Social! Best Buds Social is a mobile app that works on phones compatible with Apple's iOS mobile operating system. It is a social app that connects New York City dog owners with others looking to walk their dogs. To ensure dog walking compatibility, users have access to a swipe matching feature based on location, other dog owners' public profiles, and a chat feature where they can get to know one another.

# Technologies

The app uses Firebase/Cloud Firestore for the backend and React Native for the frontend.

(WILL EXPAND AS WE INTEGRATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES - MAP BOX, CHAT, ETC)
